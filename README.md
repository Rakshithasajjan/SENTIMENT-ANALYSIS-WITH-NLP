#This Python code performs sentiment analysis on a small set of text reviews using Logistic Regression. It begins by creating a sample dataset containing user reviews labeled as positive (1) or negative (0). Each review is preprocessed by converting to lowercase and removing special characters. The cleaned text data is then split into training and testing sets. A TF-IDF vectorizer is used to convert the text into numerical features, which helps the machine learning model understand the importance of words in each review. A Logistic Regression model is then trained on the vectorized training data and used to predict the sentiments of the test data. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix, which is also visualized using a heatmap. This provides insight into how well the model can distinguish between positive and negative sentiments in text.
